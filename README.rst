Python Helper
===========

Python helper starter provides an easy way to start a git project specifically python projects from the command line. You might find
it most useful for creating all need files, venvs, and more. Typical usage
often looks like this::

    py-helper create

This command will start creating your python and git ready project.

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. Rafael Cenzano

Check out the PyPi page `HERE <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.


Other helpful rst file stuff that will be removed

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
and ``monospace`` look like this.


A Section
=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.
